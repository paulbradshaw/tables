Add a link in your HTML to the `sortable.min.js` JavaScript library\r\n2. Add a link in your HTML to the `sortable-theme-light.css` style sheet (or one of the other style sheets published by the creators)\r\n3. Add `class=\"sortable-theme-dark\" data-sortable` to the `<table>` tag in your HTML\r\n\r\nBelow I've outlined each step. You'll also need to make sure your webpage is hosted somewhere that you can edit the HTML to include JavaScript links. GitHub Pages, for example, allows you to host webpages. I've [explained more about that here]\r\n\r\n## Turn your spreadsheet into a HTML table using Tableizer\r\n\r\n[Tableizeer](http://tableizer.journalistopia.com/) is a web-based tool which will turn data from a spreadsheet into a HTML table. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, once you have: \r\n\r\n1. Copied your data from Excel, Google Sheets, or anywhere else;\r\n2. Pasted it into the box at [tableizer.journalistopia.com](http://tableizer.journalistopia.com/);\r\n3. Clicked the *Tableize It!* button\r\n\r\n...you will be presented with a box full of HTML code that you can copy and paste into webpage HTML.\r\n\r\n",
