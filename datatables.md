# Level 2: Using the `DataTables` library to create searchable tables

Once you're happy with using the Sortable library to create sortable tables, how about making a sortable *and* **searchable** table?

[DataTables](https://datatables.net/) is a JavaScript library which will add a search box, sortable columns and page indexing to a table. 

Like Sortable, you only need to make sure your webpage has a HTML table, and do 3 things:

* Add a link in your HTML to the jQuery JavaScript library *first*
* Add a link in your HTML to the DataTables library *next*
* Add a link in your HTML to the DataTables style sheet
* Add a `class` or `id` attribute to the <table> tag in your HTML, so it can be targeted
* Add a bit of JavaScript which targets that table and applies a `DataTable` function to it

Below I've outlined each step. You'll also need to make sure your webpage is hosted somewhere that you can edit the HTML to include JavaScript links. GitHub Pages, for example, allows you to host webpages. I've [explained more about that here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/tables/blob/master/githubpages.md).

## Add the JavaScript library links

## Add the CSS link

## Add the attribute to your table

## Add the JavaScript which targets the table
